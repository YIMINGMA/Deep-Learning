# Deep-Learning

## Introduction

This repository is my notes of [Coursera Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?) by [Andrew Ng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mG4imMEAAAAJ&hl=e) and [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/).

The license of this repository is [GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License), but I still recommend limiting it to personal or academic uses.

The specialization uses [Python](https://www.python.org/) as the programming language and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) as the framework, but I provide the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) version instead. Also, I provide the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) version under the [Flux](https://fluxml.ai/Flux.jl/stable/) frame.

## Environments

Codes have been written and run in Pop!_OS 20.04 LST with

- Python: 3.8.5
