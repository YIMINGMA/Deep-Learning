\section{What is a Neural Network?}

Let us start with a housing price prediction example, in which there are $6$ houses, and you konw their prices and their sizes. Suppose you want to fit a function to predict the price of the houses given their sizes.

    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
        \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid(6,6);
        \draw (0,0) -- (1,2)--(3,0) --(5,5);
        \draw [->] (0,0) -- (2,1);
        \draw [<-] (2,3) -- (5,0);
        \draw [|->] (0.5,3) -- (0,4);
        \draw [<->] (0,6.5) -- (0,0) -- (6.5,0); % axes
